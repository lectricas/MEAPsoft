<HR>
<a name="Segmenter">
<H3>Segmenter</H3>

<P>
The segmenter analyzes the input sound file and outputs a list of
segments representing events or beats present in the sound.
</P>

<P><B>Controls:</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>input sound file:</B> select the sound you would like to
analyze. The filename of this sound will be used as the base name for
all subsequent file i/o operations. You can change this basename (if,
for instance, you want to save multiple versions of the segments file
for one input sound) in the prefs/about panel.
</LI>

<LI>
<B>detect events/detect beats:</B> the segmenter has two different
modes, "events" and "beats". "Events" mode simply detects sudden,
substantial changes in the sound. The threshold for what qualifies as
a substantial change is set via the segment sensitivity slider.
"Beats" mode is more complex; the segmenter attempts to identify the
tempo of the input sound and then outputs events that are aligned with
that tempo. This will only work well for input sounds with fairly
simple tempo/beat structures.
</LI>

<UL>
<LI> Event detector options
<UL>
<LI>
<B>segment sensitivity:</B> a low sensitivity will result in fewer
segments than a high sensitivity.  Think of this as a sensitivity to
change; if your sensitivity is high then everything will seem like an
event.
</LI>

<LI>
<B>segment density:</B> determines how closely spaced events can be; higher
density will allow very closely spaced events, while lower density
will ignore events that occur too close together.
</LI>
</UL>

<LI> Beat detector options
<UL>
<LI>
<B>cut tempo in half:</B> if the detected beat is too fast, this
option will slow it down.
</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<LI>
<B>1st event = track start:</B> This tells the segmenter to always
count the beginning of the track as the first event, even if there is
very little energy there. If a sound starts with a fade in, for
instance, and you don't have this checked, then the event detector
will probably not detect that fade in as an event and the output
segments file will not include that part of the sound.
</LI>

<LI>
<B>output segment file:</B> this is the temporary file name that will
be used to save the segments file that is generated by the
segmenter. If you want to save this file for further use, check the
appropriate box in the prefs/about panel.
</LI> 
</UL>

<HR>
<a name="Feature Extractor">
<H3>Feature Extractors</H3>


<P>Feature extractors analyze the segments in a <TT>.seg</TT> file and
output a features file containing one or more values representing the
features found. Some feature extractors, like <TT>ChunkPower</TT>,
simply put out one number representing the total power in each
segment. Others, like <TT>AvgChroma</TT>, put out an array of values
for each segment. For a short description of each feature extractor,
hover above the feature extractor's name and a tooltip will pop up.
</P>

<P>
You can select as many feature extractors as you like, although best
results are usually obtained by selecting features extractors that
work well with the composers you'll feed the <TT>.feat</TT> file to.
The number box beside each feature extractor is for entering
weights that allow you to specify the relative importance of each
feature in the analysis.
</P>

<P>
"Meta feature extractors" are a special class of FEs that do higher
level analysis on the outputs of previously run "normal" feature
extractors. In order to use a meta feature extractor, you need to
select at least one normal feature extractor in addition to the meta
feature extractor.  If "clear non-meta features" is selected, the
output features file will only contain the selected meta features.
</P>

<P>
The "Display extracted features" button is enabled after processing a
segments file. It pops up a window with a simple viewer that allows
you to inspect the values of the extracted features. This is useful if
you need to set value ranges in a Composer.
</P>

<P>Available feature extractors:
<UL>
 <LI> <B>AvgChroma</B> - 12-dimensional vector of energy distribution across
   each semitone of the octave.
 <LI> <B>AvgChromaScalar</B> - Single value giving dominant semitone within the
   octave.
 <LI> <B>AvgChunkPower</B> - Computes the average power in each chunk.
 <LI> <B>AvgFreqSimple</B> - Provides a frequency estimation for each segment of
   sound.
 <LI> <B>AvgMelSpec</B> - Computes the mean spectrum of a chunk and converts it to
   the perceptually weighted Mel frequency scale.
 <LI> <B>AvgMFCC</B> - Computes the mean MFCCs of a chunk, a commonly used feature
   in speech recognition.
 <LI> <B>AvgPitchSimple</B> - Provides a pitch estimation for each segment of
   sound.
 <LI> <B>AvgSpecCentroid</B> - Computes the average spectral center of mass of a
   chunk's frames.
 <LI> <B>AvgSpecFlatness</B> - Provides a measure of the peakiness of the chunks
   average spectrum.
 <LI> <B>AvgSpec</B> - Computes the mean spectrum or each chunk.
 <LI> <B>ChunkLength</B> - Simply returns the length of each segment.
 <LI> <B>ChunkStartTime</B> - Simply returns the start time of each segment.  Good
   for making backwards tracks!
 <LI> <B>Likelihood</B> - MetaFeatureExtractor.  Returns the
   likelihood of each chunk based on its current features. Lower
   numbers mean a segment is more common, higher numbers mean it is
   more distinct.
 <LI> <B>SpectralStability</B> - Tracks the stability of the spectral energy within
   each chunk of sound.  More spectrally stable chunks are more likely to
   be pitched material.
</UL>
</P>

<HR>
<a name="Composer">
<H3>Composers</H3>

<P>
A composer takes a feature file as an input, analyzes/sorts/modifys
the segments in that file, and then creates an Edit Decision List
(EDL) representing the order in which the segments from the original
source sound file (as well as others) should be arranged by the
Synthesizer. Composers can be very simple or very complex. For
example, "simple sort" simply sorts a features file by the first
feature in each chunk. You could use this with <TT>AvgPitchSimple</TT>
to generate a glissando where all of the pitches in the input sound
are arranged from low to high. More complex Composers, like "MashUp"
and "head bang" perform more sophisticated operations.
</P>

<P>
Each composer is described by a short text that appears when you
select it. The controls for that composer (if any) will appear below
the text.
</P>

<P>
<B>Controls:</B> Each composer's controls (if any) are different,
and should be described in that composer's explanatory text. The
following Universal Chunk Operations apply to all composers.
</P>

<UL>

  <LI><B>reverse:</B> reverse audio in each chunk. </LI>

  <LI><B>apply fade in/out:</B> to avoid pops between segments you may
want to apply a quick fade in/out at the boundaries of each
chunk. </LI>

  <LI><B>cross fade:</B> slightly shift each segment so that their
fade in/outs overlap. This generally results in smoother, less clicky
sound.</LI>

  <LI><B>fade length (ms):</B> the duration of the fade in/out, in
  milliseconds.</LI>

  <LI><strong>apply gain value:</strong> adds a gain value to each
segment in the output EDL. The synthesizer will use the gain value to
scale the amplitude of the samples it writes to the output
soundfile.</LI> <LI><strong>gain value:</strong> the gain value to add
to each segment. </LI> 
</UL>

<P>
The "Display composed features" button is like the "Display extracted
features" button above, but it works on the newly composed EDL
file. This is convenient for inspecting the results of the
composer. For instance, if you run the "simple sort" composer and
display the EDL file you will see that the jumpy colors in the .feat
file have been turned into a smooth fade in the sorted EDL.
</P>

<P>
Available composers:
<UL>
 <LI> <B>BlipComposer</B> - BlipComposer inserts a blip at the beginning of each
   chunk in the input features file. Especially useful for
   understanding the output of the segmenter.
 <LI> <B>EDLComposer</B> - EDLComposer applies composer options (gain,
   crossfade, etc.) to an existing .edl file. It is meant to be used to
   generate output from the visualizers.
 <LI> <B>HeadBangComposer</B> - HeadBangComposer rocks it hard-core style. Finds
   the most common chunk length L and lengths related by a factor of
   2, i.e. L/2, L/4, L/8, L*2.  These chunks are then shuffled to
   create a new piece with a clear beat.
 <LI> <B>HMMComposer</B> - HMMComposer uses a features file to train
   a simple statistical model of a song and uses it to randomly
   generate a new sequence of chunks.  This works best when used with
   chunks created by the beat detector.
 <LI> <B>IntraChunkShuffleComposer</B> - IntraChunkShuffleComposer chops each
   chunk up into small pieces and rearranges them. This keeps
   the meta chunks intact but scrambles them on a local level.
 <LI> <B>MashupComposer</B> - MashupComposer attempts to match chunks in the
   input features file using chunks from the chunk database
   features file. The result is the source sound file created
   from chunks in the chunk database.
 <LI> <B>MeapaeMComposer</B> - MeapaeMComposer makes palindromes by writing each
   chunk of audio forward and then backward.
 <LI> <B>NNComposer</B> - NNComposer starts at the first chunk and proceeds
   through the sound file from each chunk to its nearest neighbor,
   according to the features in the input features file.
 <LI> <B>RotComposer</B> - RotComposer rotates the beats in each measure by a
   selectable number of positions. You can set the number of
   beats/measure, the number of positions to rotate, and the direction
   of rotation.
 <LI> <B>SortComposer</B> - SortComposer sorts the features in ascending or
   descending order. If there are multiple features, or more than one
   value per feature, it sorts according to distance in Euclidean
   space.
 <LI> <B>ThresholdComposer</B> - ThresholdComposer selects chunks with feature
   values falling inside the top and bottom thresholds. It then
   creates an output file composed exclusively of either the selected
   chunks or the not-selected chunks. ThresholdComposer only really
   makes sense for one-dimensional features like pitch and power.
 <LI> <B>VQComposer</B> - VQComposer trains a vector quantizer on the
    chunks in the input file.  It then uses it to quantize the chunks
    in another file.  For best results use the beat segmenter so each
    chunk has roughly the same length.
</P>
</UL>

<HR>
<a name="Synthesizer">
<H3>Synthesizer</H3>

<P>
The Synthesizer uses the EDL from a composer to construct a new audio
file. The output sound file name is automatically set to the input
sound file name + <TT>MEAPED.wav</TT>. You can change this if you
like. Once the new audio file has been created the "Listen" button
will be active. Clicking on the button will launch your preferred
<TT>.wav</TT> playback application.
</P>

<HR>
<a name="Preferences">
<H3>Prefs/About</H3>

<P>
System wide preferences are set here. 
</P>

<UL>

<LI>
<B>file i/o base name:</B> this is the prefix used when creating temp
files during processing steps.  You can usually leave this as is. The
primary reason to change this is if you are saving the intermediate
output files for further use/analysis.</LI>

<LI>
<B>audio player:</B> select the program that will be used to play
audio when clicking on the listen buttons in the segmenter and
synthesizer tabs.</LI>

<LI>
<B>save .seg .edl .feat files:</B> Normally intermediate output files
are not saved. However, if you are going to process the same file a
number of times, you can save time by saving some of the output files
and reusing them on each pass. For instance, you might save the output
of the segmenter and then on subsequent runs you can disable the
segmenter and just use the saved <TT>.seg</TT> file instead of wasting
time reanalyzing the file each time around.  
</LI> 
</UL> 

<HR>
<a name="Visualizer">
<H3>Visualizer</H3>

<P>
The Visualizer presents data from .feat and .edl files in a variety of
graphical formats. Mouse over a chunk to inspect its data in the "chunk data" 
frame on the left side of the screen. Click on chunks to select/deselect. 
Click and drag to select regions. Shift + click to add to selection.
</P>
<P>
The available visualizers are:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<b>segement order</b>: segments and feature values from the .feat file are at the 
top of the screen, segments and features from the corresponding .edl file are at the 
bottom. Multi-dimensional features are presented spectrogram style. The .feat file
chunks are drawn in their original time order. The .edl chunks are drawn in their
composed time order. A line is drawn from each .feat chunk to the corresponding .edl
chunk (which is the same chunk shifted in time). "multi lines" and "thick lines" are
just candy.
</LI>
<LI>
<b>scatter plot</b>: features are mapped to drawing parameters (x axis, y axis, height,
width, color) and each chunk is drawn in the appropriate place. You might, for example, 
map start time to the x axis and pitch to the y axis to display pitch contours over time. 
</LI>
<LI>
<b>bar graph</b>: one bar graph is drawn for each feature. "show" allows you to display
the chunks in their original .feat time order or in their composed .edl time order. 
"height" allows you to map different values (start time, dest time, length, features)
 onto the height parameter. 
</LI>
<LI>
<b>line graph</b>: really stupid!
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
General controls:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>visualization type:</B> select which visualization technique to use
</LI>
<LI>
<B>load files:</B> select and load a new .feat and .edl file (you can also
load just a .feat file if you choose.)
</LI>
<LI>
<B>save .feat/.edl:</B> saves the selected chunks to a new .feat or .edl file
</LI>
<LI>
<b>synthesizer:</b> plays selected chunks in either .feat or .edl order.
</LI>
<LI>
<b>zoom</b>: zooms!
</LI>
<LI>
<b>selection controls</b>: mostly self-explanatory. "apply selection filter" allows you
to select chunks numerically.
